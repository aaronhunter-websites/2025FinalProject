      <h3 id="concept">Concept & Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
      <em>Honors Arcana</em> is a single player roguelike game designed by Aaron Hunter for the final project of IS 201. 
      While I designed the game concept and mechanics, the bulk of the actual game code was created using ChatGPT.
      In accordance with assignment instructions, all game code is contained in a single HTML file.
      
      </p>   
      <p>
         My initial idea for this project was to do the meme of running <em>Doom</em> in a comically simple medium. 
         Look up "weird things people have used to play Doom" and you'll see what I mean. As such, my first game attempt was 
         a <em>Doom</em> rip off, which you can play <a href="doomish.html" target="_blank">here.</a> Honestly, I'm impressed that AI was able 
         to make a 3 dimensional game in a single html file at all, but because it was trying to meet a higher standard 
         (3d), its failure to do so made it feel painfully low quality.
      </p>
      <p>
         Accordingly, I decided that it would be better to have a simple game that was designed well than a complicated 
         one that felt cheap. Inspired by early video games such as <em>Legend of Zelda, Pac-Man,</em> and <em>Earthbound,</em> 
         I wanted to create an arcade-like top-down game with an emphasis on different fantasy classes. However, 
         I realized that the classic fantasy party (consisting of a warrior, a rogue, a priest, and a mage) would be difficult 
         to implement in this context. </p>
      <p>
         I had ideas for game mechanics I thought would be cool, but several of them were too 
         complex for this project. I ended up keeping the vibe of these ideas (largely inspired by MOBAs), but 
         reduced the scope to be just about mages. Each mage class has a basic attack and a cooldown-based ability, the details
         of which are described below.
      </p>

         <br> 

      <h3 id="classes">The Mage Classes</h3>
      <div class="classes">

         <h4>Frost</h4>
            <p>
               The frost mage's ability is a large cone that freezes all enemies it hits for a short duration,
               which gets longer for each additional enemy caught in the cone. Although the frost mage's basic attack
               deals low damage normally, it deals significant bonus damage to frozen enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
               As of version 1.1.0, hitting a frozen target with a basic attack also deals small AOE damage in a short radius (frost shards)
            </p>

         <h4>Blood</h4>
            
            <p>
            The blood mage's basic attack costs 1 heart per use, but cannot use their last heart. Their ability is a short cone
            that deals damage (blood power increases damage of ability more than basic attack) and restores hearts per enemies hit.</p>
            
            The blood mage's unique mechanic, blood power, corresponds to their current hit points relative to their max
            and affects both their ability and their basic attacks:
            <ul>
                  <li>Blood Power 1: mage has 76% or more of their total health remaining</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Mage deals 50% less damage</li>
                        <li>Ability does not heal</li>
                     </ul>
                     <br>

                  <li>Blood Power 2: mage has 75% or less of their total health remaining</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Mage deals normal damage</li>
                        <li>Ability heals 1 heart per enemy hit</li>
                     </ul>
                     <br>

                  <li>Blood Power 3: mage has 50% or less of their total health remaining</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Mage deals 40% more damage </li>
                        <li>Ability heals 2 hearts per enemy hit</li>
                        <li>Basic attack pierces through 1 enemy</li>
                     </ul>
                     <br>

                  <li>Blood Power 4: mage has 25% or less of their total health remaining</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Mage deals 100% more damage </li> 
                        <li>Ability heals 3 hearts per enemy hit</li>
                        <li>Basic attack pierces through 2 enemies</li>
                     </ul>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fire</h4>
               <p>
                  The fire mage's ability is a large fireball that does high damage in a large radius when it detonates.
                  Their ability has a long cooldown, but this cooldown is reduced each time the mage hits enemies with
                  their short cone basic attack. This cooldown reduction is increased for each enemy hit by the basic attack.

               </p>
            
      
      </div>
      <h3 id="upgrades">Post-room Upgrades</h3>
      <div class="classes">
            After each room, the player is presented with a choice between three upgrade options. The first two are always the same, 
            but the third changes randomly.
         <ol>
            <li>Fully restores the player's HP</li>
               
            <li>Increase player's max HP by 2 hearts.</li>

            <li>Changing option</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Increase all player damage by 15%</li>
                  <li>Increase player movement speed by 12%</li>
                  <li>Reduce ability cooldown by 15%</li>

               </ul>

      <h3 id="enemies">Enemy Types (in order of threat level)</h3>

            <li>Chasers</li>
            <img src="Images/chaserPic.png" alt="Picture of chaser enemy in Honors Arcana">
               <ul>
                     <li>The most basic enemy type</li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Makes up about 80% of enemies in early rooms and about 55% in later rooms</li>
                        </ul>
                     <li>Chase the player at a moderate speed</li>
                     <li>Deal solid damage and have a decent number of hit points</li>
                     <li>Adds pressure for the player to keep moving</li>
               </ul>
            <li>Skitters</li>
            <img src="Images/skitterPic.png" alt="Picture of skitter enemy in Honors Arcana">
               <ul>
                  <li>Mechanically similar to chasers but with different stats and spawn rates</li>
                     <ul> 
                        <li>Makes up about 18% of enemies in early rooms and about 25% in later rooms</li>
                     </ul>
                  <li>Quite a bit faster than chasers</li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>However, they have almost half as many hit points</li>
                           <li>They also deal slightly less damage</li>
                        </ul>

               </ul>
            <li>Shooters</li>
            <img src="Images/shooterPic.png" alt="Picture of shooter enemy in Honors Arcana">
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     As their name implies, rather than following the player like chasers and skitters, shooters keep 
                     distance and use ranged attacks
                  </li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              This provides an element of zone control, requiring the player to be mindful of their movements 
                              and use terrain to provide cover
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                  <li>Their base HP and damage are between those of chasers and skitters, but their speed is notably less</li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              This makes it easier for the player to close distance if necessary (such as for the fire mage's 
                              basic attack) despite the shooters' efforts to keep away 
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                  <li>Despite their relatively low speed, shooters tend to be the most difficult of the basic enemy types</li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              Accordingly, in early rooms they're only about 2% of the enemies and never become more than 20%
                              even in the late game
                           </li>

                        </ul>
               </ul>
            <li>Summoners</li>
            <img src="Images/summonerPic.png" alt="Picture of summoner enemy in Honors Arcana">
               <ul> 
                  <li>Summoners are unique in a few ways</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           rather than having a specific spawn rate throughout the game, summoners don't appear till room 13, after which 
                           there is guaranteed to be 1 summoner per room
                        </li>
